This RSFQ cell library is developed under the IARPA SuperTools/ColdFlux contract via the U.S. Army
Research Office grant W911NF-17-1-0120. The aim is to create a generic and open-source cell library
with RSFQ logic as part of the IARPA SuperTools.

The free and open-source tools gschem, JoSIM, JoSIM-tools, KLayout and TimEx are used to develop
and test the RSFQ cells. The circuit schematics are drawn using gschem. JoSIM is used as the SPICE
engine for simulating the cells, while JoSIM-tools is used for operating margin analysis as well as
cell parameter optimization. KLayout is used to construct the cell layouts. TimEx is used to
extract the characteristics of the cell to generate the Mealy Finite State Machine diagram and
Verilog files. Icarus Verilog and GTKWave can be used to simulate and view the verilog files for
each cell. Additionally, InductEx is used for impedance extraction during cell layout design and
InductEx-LVS is used for layout versus schematic analysis. A free version of InductEx is available,
but has limited capacity.

Version 3.0 of the RSFQ cell library includes two versions of each cell: one with standard
connections designed to be connected directly with other cells, and a version designed to be
connected to Passive Transmission Lines (PTLs). The version of the cell designed to be connected to
PTLs include integrated PTL transmitter and receiver cells. To indicate the integration of PTL
transmitters and receivers within a cell, the letter `T' is added at the end of a cell name, for
example the DFF with integrated PTL transmitters and receivers will be referred to as DFFT.

The following core cells are included in v3p0 of the RSFQ cell library:
  - Interconnects: JTL, JTLT, SPLIT, SPLITT, MERGE, MERGET, PTLTX, PTLRX, Always0 (synchronous and
  asynchronous) and - - Always0T (synchronous and asynchronous).
  - Logic cells: AND2, AND2T, OR2, OR2T, XOR, XORT, NOT, NOTT, XNOR.
  - Buffers: DFF, DFFT, NDRO, NDROT, BUFF and BUFFT.
  - Interfacing cells: DCSFQ, DCSFQ-PTLTX, PTLRX-SFQDC and SFQDC.

More complex functions can be constructed through connecting several core cells. The cells are
currently optimized to run at a maximum clock frequency of 50 GHz.

!...The gschem schematic files are included as a visual reference. If any inconsistencies
arise between the gschem schematic and the .cir file, the .cir file should be assumed
as correct...!
